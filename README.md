EcoKidz is an innovative iOS app designed to educate and empower the next generation to tackle plastic waste pollution. As the winner of the ImpactHub Philippines 2021 Hackathon in the climate change vertical, EcoKidz uses engaging storytelling and gamification to help users complete challenges tailored by advocacy-driven organizations. As they progress, they earn points, vouchers, and proof of their social impact, which can be redeemed for real-world rewards. EcoKidz motivates and equips the youth to make a tangible difference in their communities.
